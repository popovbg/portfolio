# portfolio
This is a Responsive Personal Portfolio website which i create by myself from scratch with pure CSS.
# I have practice over flex and grid properties dropdown menus and interact with libary called AOS which i used to animate the cards, some of them are flipping, othres are zoom in and so on, i really enjoy working ot this project.
